- Certificate chain validation
- Signature algorithm security
- Key size requirements
- Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
- Certificate Authorities (CAs)
- Certificate lifecycle management

## Security Issues Detected

### Critical Issues
- **Expired Certificates** - Certificate has passed NotAfter date
- **Weak Key Size** - RSA keys < 2048 bits or ECC keys < 256 bits
- **Self-Signed Certificates** - Not trusted by browsers

### High Severity Issues
- **Weak Signature Algorithms** - MD5, SHA1 algorithms
- **Missing SANs** - No Subject Alternative Names defined
- **Certificate Expiring Soon** - Less than 30 days remaining

### Medium Severity Issues
- **CN Mismatch** - Common Name doesn't match domain
- **Excessive Validity Period** - Validity > 825 days
- **Empty Common Name** - No CN set in certificate

### Low Severity Issues
- **No Key Usage** - Missing key usage constraints
- **Long Validity Period** - Between 398-825 days

## Remediation Guide

### For Expired Certificates
```
1. Generate new Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
2. Submit to Certificate Authority
3. Install new certificate immediately
4. Update all dependent systems
```

### For Weak Algorithms
```
1. Request certificate with SHA-256 or stronger
2. Use 2048-bit RSA minimum (4096-bit recommended)
3. Or use 256-bit ECC keys
4. Update certificate before expiration
```

### For Self-Signed Certificates
```
1. Obtain certificate from trusted CA (Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, etc.)
2. Properly configure certificate chain
3. Ensure root and intermediate certificates are included
4. Test in multiple browsers
```
