### DES (Data Encryption Standard) - Theory and Example

#### Overview of DES
DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key algorithm used for encrypting and decrypting data. Developed by IBM in the 1970s and later adopted as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), DES became a widely-used method for secure data transmission. 

DES operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 64-bit key (of which only 56 bits are used, with the remaining 8 bits reserved for error checking). The algorithm works by applying a series of transformations to both the data and the key, involving permutations, substitutions, and XOR operations.

Despite being widely used for many years, DES has since been considered insecure due to advances in computational power, and it has been replaced by more secure algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). However, DES still serves as a fundamental concept in understanding block ciphers and encryption.

#### Key Concepts of DES

1. **Symmetric-Key Cipher**: 
   DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This requires the sender and receiver to securely share the secret key.

2. **Block Cipher**:
   DES processes the data in fixed-size blocks (64 bits). If the message is longer than the block size, it is divided into smaller blocks and processed individually.

3. **Key Size**: 
   The DES key length is 64 bits, but only 56 of those bits are used for encryption. The remaining 8 bits are used for parity (error checking). A 56-bit key means there are 2^56 possible keys, which was considered secure at the time DES was developed, but is now vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

4. **Feistel Structure**: 
   DES uses a Feistel network, a symmetric structure that repeatedly applies a round function to the input data. In each round, the input is split into two halves: the left half is processed using a round function and the result is XORed with the right half. Then, the halves are swapped, and this process continues for 16 rounds.

5. **Initial Permutation (IP) and Final Permutation (IP⁻¹)**:
   The input block undergoes an initial permutation (IP) before encryption begins. After the 16 rounds of processing, the final output undergoes an inverse permutation (IP⁻¹) to restore the bits to their final positions. These permutations serve to shuffle the bits for diffusion, making it harder to analyze the relationships between the ciphertext and plaintext.

6. **Key Schedule**:
   DES generates 16 subkeys, one for each round of encryption. The key schedule involves applying permutations to the original key, splitting it into halves, shifting the halves, and recombining them to form the subkeys.

7. **Round Function**:
   Each round of DES applies a specific transformation, often referred to as the "round function." The right half of the data block is expanded using an expansion permutation, XORed with the round subkey, and then passed through substitution boxes (S-boxes), which introduce non-linearity. The result is permuted again and XORed with the left half of the data block.

8. **S-Boxes**:
   DES uses 8 different substitution boxes (S-boxes) that take a 6-bit input and produce a 4-bit output. The S-boxes add non-linearity to the algorithm, which helps to obscure the relationship between the key and the ciphertext.

9. **XOR Operation**:
   XOR (exclusive OR) is a critical operation in DES. XOR allows for bitwise manipulation where bits are flipped based on the key and intermediate results, making it harder to reverse the encryption without knowing the key.

10. **Final Permutation (FP)**:
   After the 16 rounds, the final result undergoes the final permutation (IP⁻¹) to produce the final ciphertext.

#### Example of DES Encryption

Consider an example where we want to encrypt the 64-bit block of plaintext `1101011100111000` using a 10-bit key `1001100110`.

1. **Initial Permutation (IP)**:
   The plaintext block is rearranged according to the initial permutation table. For simplicity, we'll assume an IP that shuffles the bits as follows:
   
   Initial plaintext: `1101011100111000`
   After IP: `1011100110110001`

2. **Key Generation**:
   The 10-bit key `1001100110` is permuted (using a permutation table like P10) and split into two halves. Each half is shifted and recombined to form two 8-bit subkeys (K1 and K2). 

   For simplicity:
   - K1 = `10100110`
   - K2 = `11001001`

3. **Round 1**:
   The permuted plaintext is split into two halves:
   - Left half (L0) = `1011`
   - Right half (R0) = `1001`

   The right half (R0) is expanded and permuted using an expansion table (E_P) to get:
   - Expanded R0 = `11010011`

   The expanded R0 is XORed with the subkey K1:
   - `11010011 XOR 10100110 = 01110101`

   The result is then split into two halves:
   - Left of XOR result: `0111`
   - Right of XOR result: `0101`

   These halves are passed through S-boxes (S0 and S1). Assuming the following S-box outputs:
   - S0(0111) = `01`
   - S1(0101) = `11`

   These S-box outputs are concatenated and permuted using a permutation table (P4):
   - Permuted output = `1100`

   The left half (L0) is XORed with this result:
   - `1011 XOR 1100 = 0111`

   After this round, we swap the halves:
   - New Left half (L1) = `1001` (previous R0)
   - New Right half (R1) = `0111`

4. **Round 2**:
   The process is repeated for the second round with subkey K2. Using the same steps as before, we:
   - Expand and permute R1.
   - XOR the expanded R1 with K2.
   - Apply the S-boxes and permutation P4.
   - XOR with the left half (L1).
   - No swapping happens after the second round.

5. **Final Permutation (IP⁻¹)**:
   After both rounds are completed, the resulting block is permuted again using the inverse permutation (IP⁻¹) to produce the final ciphertext.

   Assuming an inverse permutation table, the final ciphertext could be:
   - Final ciphertext: `0110111001110100`

This ciphertext is the encrypted form of the original plaintext block using DES.

#### Example: Decryption

For decryption, the same process is followed in reverse order:
- Apply the key schedule to generate the same subkeys (K1, K2).
- Apply the rounds in reverse order, using K2 in the first round and K1 in the second round.
- Finally, apply the inverse permutation to recover the original plaintext.

### Conclusion

DES uses a combination of substitution, permutation, and XOR operations to secure data. Although it is no longer considered secure due to its small key size, DES remains a foundational block cipher that introduces key concepts used in modern cryptography. Understanding the DES algorithm helps in grasping the principles behind symmetric encryption, block ciphers, and secure data transmission.
